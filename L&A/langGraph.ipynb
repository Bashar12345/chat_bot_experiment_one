    "# Key Features of LangGraph\n",
    "Graph-Based Workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflows are represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent tasks and edges represent dependencies.\n",
    "This structure allows parallel execution of independent tasks, optimizing performance.\n",
    "Modular Design:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes in the graph can represent reusable functions or processes.\n",
    "Workflows can be easily updated or extended by adding/removing nodes.\n",
    "Dependency Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph handles task dependencies automatically, ensuring tasks are executed in the correct order.\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Designed to handle complex, large-scale workflows efficiently.\n",
    "Supports parallel execution and asynchronous processing.\n",
    "Flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrates easily with other tools, APIs, and libraries.\n",
    "Suitable for various domains, such as data processing, AI/ML pipelines, chatbot development, and more.\n",
    "Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust error-handling mechanisms allow workflows to recover from failures or skip problematic nodes."

    "## Graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall workflow represented as a collection of interconnected nodes.\n",
    "Node:\n",
    "\n",
    "A single unit of work or task in the workflow.\n",
    "Each node has:\n",
    "A name (identifier).\n",
    "A function to execute.\n",
    "Dependencies (other nodes it depends on).\n",
    "\n",

    "## Edges:\n",
    "\n",
    "Connections between nodes, defining the execution order.\n",
    "Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph is executed by processing each node in dependency order, either sequentially or in parallel."
