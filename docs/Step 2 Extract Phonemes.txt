Step 2: Extract Phonemes from Audio
You need a phoneme recognizer to analyze audio. Options include:

Forced Alignment Tools: Align the audio with the transcription to generate phoneme timing.
Libraries: Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA), aeneas, or gentle.



Pre-trained ASR Models with Phoneme Outputs:
Use ASR models (e.g., Wav2Vec2, Kaldi) trained to output phoneme sequences instead of text.


Wav2Vec2: A cutting-edge ASR model from Facebook AI. While itâ€™s typically used for transcription, you can fine-tune it to output phonemes.
