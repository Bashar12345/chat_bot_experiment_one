Define the Scope of AI Assistance


For Personalized Guidance and Support:

Collect user-specific data like:
Progress (e.g., exercises completed, common mistakes).
User goals (e.g., mastering British or American accents).
Use this data to tailor responses:
Provide targeted tips (e.g., “Focus on reducing stress on vowels like /æ/ in British English.”).
Suggest exercises based on performance.




For Answering User Questions:

Examples of user questions:
“How do I pronounce the /r/ sound in American English?”
“Why does intonation matter in British accents?”
Use the AI model to:
Detect key terms in the question (e.g., "pronounce /r/").
Provide explanations with examples and actionable tips.
