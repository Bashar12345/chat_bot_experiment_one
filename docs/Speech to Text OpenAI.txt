Speech-to-Text:
OpenAI Whisper or Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.
Accent Detection:
Pre-trained models or fine-tuned models (e.g., based on Wav2Vec2 or OpenAI's Whisper).
Text-to-Speech:
Amazon Polly or Google Text-to-Speech.
Audio Processing:
librosa, pydub, speechbrain.


Implementation Steps
Step 1: Speech Recognition
Use Whisper API to convert speech to text.
Detect phonemes and linguistic features for accent analysis.



Step 2: Accent Detection
Train a model on American accents using datasets like:
VoxForge: Crowdsourced speech data.
LibriSpeech: Large-scale ASR corpus.
Common Voice: Open-source speech dataset by Mozilla.
Alternatively, fine-tune a pre-trained model like Wav2Vec2.




Step 3: Accent Demonstration
Use text-to-speech models to synthesize accents. For example:
General American: Balanced and neutral.
Southern: Pronounced drawl with elongated vowels.
New York: Non-rhotic "r" sounds and sharp vowels.
Step 4: Pronunciation Feedback
Use librosa or praat-parselmouth for phoneme extraction and alignment.
Compare user audio with reference pronunciation.
Highlight errors like incorrect vowel length, intonation, or stress.
Step 5: Design Interactive Lessons
Create exercises like:
Listening and repeating phrases.
Sentence-building with correct intonation.
Word stress challenges.
Step 6: Gamification
Add progress levels (e.g., Beginner to Advanced).
Introduce challenges, leaderboards, and rewards.
