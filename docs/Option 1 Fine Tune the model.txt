Option 1: Fine-Tune the Model
Fine-tune facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h on a phoneme-labeled dataset.
Follow these steps:
Prepare a dataset with audio files and corresponding phoneme sequences.
Use a library like Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers to fine-tune the model.
Save the fine-tuned model and use it for inference.
Option 2: Use a Pre-Fine-Tuned Model
Look for a model that is already fine-tuned for phoneme recognition.
Check the Hugging Face Model Hub for models specific to phoneme transcription.
Option 3: Use the Current Model for General Speech Recognition
If phoneme transcription is not strictly required, you can use the model for general speech-to-text tasks without fine-tuning.
