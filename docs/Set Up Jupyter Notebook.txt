Set Up Jupyter Notebook for Remote Access
Youâ€™ll use Jupyter Notebook to access and run Hugging Face models from the non-GPU PC.

a. Configure Jupyter Notebook on the GPU PC:
Generate a Jupyter Notebook configuration file:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook --generate-config
This creates a config file, usually located at ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py.

Set a password for Jupyter:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook password
Open the configuration file and update the following:

Uncomment and set the IP to allow connections from any device:
arduino
Copy
Edit
c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0'
Uncomment and set the port:
yaml
Copy
Edit
c.NotebookApp.port = 8888
Uncomment and set it to not launch a browser:
graphql
Copy
Edit
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook --allow-root
b. Access the Jupyter Notebook from the Non-GPU PC:
Find the GPU PC's IP address by running ipconfig in the Command Prompt on the GPU PC.
Open a web browser on the non-GPU PC and go to:
arduino
Copy
Edit
http://<GPU-PC-IP>:8888
Log in with the password you set earlier.
